# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is my personal website code. Right now it is planned to be a homepage with a bio and personal image. It will include a blog page for eventual blogs, and contact me functionality. This will absolutely expand as time passes, but for now will be very basic.

## Note

Contact me feature will not function from this code alone - usernames and passwords are stored in a config server that is not included here.
